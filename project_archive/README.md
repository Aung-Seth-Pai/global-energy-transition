## Archived Project (Original Dataset)

This folder contains the original version of the **Global Energy Transition** project, built using the first dataset explored during development. It includes all preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis, data-collection scripts, and automation tools created before transitioning to a more complete and refined dataset.

The contents are preserved here for **version history**.

## What’s Inside

### Notebooks
- `01_preprocessing_old.ipynb`
- `02_EDA_old.ipynb`

Early data cleaning, transformation, and exploratory analysis based on the original dataset.

---

### Data
- `data/raw/` – raw CSVs and shapefiles used in the initial workflow  
- `data/processed/` – intermediate cleaned datasets and profiles  

> **Note:** All data files remain excluded from version control; only the folder structure is kept.

---

### Scripts
- `download_data.sh` – automated data download script  
- `fetch_iso_codes.py` – ISO code scraping utility

## Why This Folder Exists

During the project, a more complete, cleaner, and better-structured dataset was identified.  
To ensure the final analysis is accurate and meaningful, the project was migrated to the new dataset.

This archive preserves the original work, including:
- data engineering steps  
- scraping and automation scripts  
- early EDA and preprocessing  
- the initial project structure  

This allows the evolution of the project to remain visible while keeping the main repository clean and focused.

## Current Development

All ongoing work — including updated preprocessing, EDA, modeling, and visualizations — now lives in the **main project directory** using the new dataset.
